      <h3>Welcome to Carbuncle</h3>
      <p>With this tutorial you will have the base understanding on how to build a game and  play it using Carbuncle.</p>
      <p>As of today, this version is lacking documentation and some features, but it's possible to build games using this.</p>
      <h3>Setting Up</h3>
      <h4>Setting Up on Windows</h4>
      <p>Just download the binary file at the homepage and you are ready to go!</p>
      <h4>Setting Up on Mac OSX</h4>
      <p>On Mac the process is mostly the same, you will probably require to authorize it to run on your PC in the security tab for now.</p>
      <h4>Setting Up on Other platforms</h4>
      <p>At the moment, the rest of the platforms are not being built. In the future, ports to iOS, Android and Linux are planned.</p>
      <h3>Starting your new game</h3>
      <h4>Using the application as your game executable</h4>
      <p>At the current version, Carbuncle requires a main.rb file to run. So create the following file named main.rb and put it in some folder:</p>
      <pre class="line-numbers" data-src="./snippets/empty-game.rb"></pre>
      <p>Since Carbuncle 0.4 onwards, new methods can now be used for your application:</p>
      <h4>Using Carbuncle as a command line executable</h4>
      <p>You can now just do: <code>$ /your/path/to/carbuncle /your/game/folder</code>.</p>
      <p>You can use this method to develop your game, but when you are done, you should use the distributable version below.</p>
      <h4>Launching code from the same folder</h4>
      <p>If Carbuncle reads a main.rb from the same folder it is currently installed, it will run that.</p>
      <p>This is used to distribute your game with the carbuncle version you were using.</p>
      <p><strong>Note for MacOS users</strong> Because the Mac OSX version is an APP and not a binary file, your <code>main.rb</code>
        should be inside your <code>mac.app/Contents/MacOS</code> folder.
        You can always see the package's contents by right clicking and selecting "view package's contents"
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>Now click on your application folder and you should see an empty window:</p>

      </div>
